# Pete's Pet Shop DApp

As part of my university assignment, work was done on Pete's Pet Shop DAppâ€”a beginner-friendly decentralized application designed to introduce users to blockchain development using the Truffle Suite. This project involves documenting the process of creating, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts while building a fun and interactive pet shop interface. It is based on the tutorial by [Truffle Suite](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/guides/pet-shop/).

## Overview

Pete's Pet Shop DApp offers an engaging, step-by-step tutorial for those new to decentralized applications. With this project, the following can be learnt:
- **Develop Smart Contracts:** Write, compile, and deploy Solidity contracts.
- **Set Up a Local Blockchain:** Use Ganache to simulate an Ethereum network for testing.
- **Build a User Interface:** Create a responsive front-end that connects with your smart contracts using web3.js.
- **Integrate Blockchain Tools:** Seamlessly connect MetaMask to interact with your deployed DApp.


## Getting Started

To get started:
1. **Review the Guide:** Open the accompanying <a href="Truffle Suite - Pet Shop Tutorial.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> for a detailed report on going through the actual tutorial with interactive descriptions and screenshots.
4. **Walk-through the Tutorial:** Follow the offical tutorial for detailed instructions
5. **Set Up Your Environment:** Install the necessary tools (Node.js, Truffle, Ganache, etc.) as outlined in the guide.
6. **Deploy and Test:** Follow the tutorial to compile and deploy your smart contracts, then run tests to ensure everything works.
7. **Launch the DApp:** Start the development server, connect with MetaMask, and begin interacting with the pet shop interface.
